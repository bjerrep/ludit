**********

Below is a starting point for a /boot/config.txt matching a Raspberry Pi 3 B+. Most importantly is enabling turbo mode to prevent the cpu from changing its frequency dynamically. This will have a negative effect on Twitse time measurements.

Next the RPI's are overclocked. They are not exactly speed kings and they can use a little boost. Common sense would dictate that overclocking must have a positive effect on the Twitse time measurements but this haven't really been verified.
